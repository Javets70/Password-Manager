## Password-Manager
A simple password manager that uses the Fernet module from the [Cryptography](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) library.

We STRONGLY recommend first obfuscating the program then using it, a library like pyarmor will work fine.

## Installation

```bash
$ pip install cryptography
```
